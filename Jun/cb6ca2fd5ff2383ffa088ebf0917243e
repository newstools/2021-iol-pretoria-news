Following an influx of applicants, both physical and online, by doctors and nurses for jobs at Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria, the hospital has explained that a social media message causing this had been misunderstood. Chief Executive Dr Mathabo Mathebula said the message, which had circulated widely on WhatsApp and referred to the hospital asking for nurses and doctors, should be ignored by hopefuls. "Posts for vacancies get advertised on approved platforms, and walk-ins applications of professionals are also welcomed. "Please do not send to any of the given email addresses as they will not be considered. We apologise for any inconvenience caused." This follows the viral message, with Tuesday’s date reading: "Anyone knowing a doctor or a nurse looking for work please direct them to us.” It further said the health workers were required for Covid-19 assistance, and it gave the email addresses of Dr Mathebula, Dr Ramlall, Professor Rheeder, and Ms Mowayo. The hospital explained that the message had been inappropriate, especially at a time when employment was in demand, but also when people were coming in to submit applications in their numbers, not in accordance with regulations. Mathebula declared the message 'null' and also said it was unfortunate that at a time when job seekers were desperate, such a message raised their hope. Pretoria News
