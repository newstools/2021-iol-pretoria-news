Johannesburg – The ANC has expressed shock and sadness on the passing away of Queen Shiyiwe Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, Regent of the Zulu Nation. Dlamini Zulu, 65, passed away on Thursday after a short illness. “The ANC has learnt with shock and sadness about the untimely passing of Her Majesty Dlamini Zulu,” said ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe.
