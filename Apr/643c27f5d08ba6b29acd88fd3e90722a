Pretoria - Two members of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) based at Vaal Rand in South Africa’s Gauteng province have appeared in court after being arrested for stealing money from a cash-in-transit crime scene. The pair appeared in court on Tuesday facing charges including theft and defeating the ends of justice, Hawks national spokeswoman Colonel Katlego Mogale said in a statement. “The (Hawks) national head, Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya welcomed the arrest of the two warrant officers by the serious corruption investigation team based in the Vaal Rand,” she said. Rapulane Levy Tlholoe and Ndavheleseni Edward Musetha, who are attached to the Hawks’ serious organised crime investigation unit, were both arrested on Tuesday morning. “It is alleged that the duo was on duty in January this year when they attended to a cash in-transit crime scene in the Langlaagte area, Johannesburg for investigation. They allegedly placed the scattered cash inside four forensic seal bags to book them at the police station,” said Mogale. At the police station, the officers however only submitted two of the forensic bags. “Further investigation revealed that the suspects kept one torn sealed forensic bag with undisclosed amount of money in their vehicle. More cash was discovered allegedly inside the cubbyhole and later placed into another sealed bag to be submitted as evidence, with one sealed bag missing,” said Mogale. Lebeya said it was disheartening, yet necessary to arrest the Hawks’ own members if they were implicated in crime. African News Agency (ANA)
