ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday appeared unfazed by efforts to unseat him at the governing party’s upcoming national general council (NGC). Ramaphosa spoke after laying wreaths on the graves of Struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and her daughter, Zindzi Mandela, in Fourways, north of Johannesburg. ”NGCs are not about removing or installing anyone. The NGC is about renewing our policies, the implementation and where we are and thereafter we hold our policy conference, and thereafter we hold a leadership electing conference, which is in 2022,” Ramaphosa said. He also announced that the Covid-19 vaccination programme would be sped up. ”The minister of health (Dr Zweli Mkhize) will soon be announcing that now we have signed all the agreements and that we are waiting for delivery and the vaccination programme will now get under way with a great deal of speed,” Ramaphosa said. He explained that the ANC national executive committee demanded that the vaccination process be sped up. ”That is what the government is going to focus on,” Ramaphosa promised. Johannesburg mayor Geoff Makhubo also announced that the city’s William Nicol Drive will be renamed after Winnie Madikizela-Mandela within two months. ”I was here 12 months ago to launch the public participation process of renaming of city’s William Nicol to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. We are on the last leg of the consultation and there’s a concerted effort from our side that we do this in the next two months,” Makhubo said. He added that the provincial road should not be named William Nicol any more. Political Bureau
