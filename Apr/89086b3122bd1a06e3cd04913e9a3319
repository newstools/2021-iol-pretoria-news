JOHANNESBURG – Former chief executive of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa), Lucky Montana is due to appear at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry this morning but in an exclusive interview with the Daily News, he accused deputy chief Justice Raymond Zondo of premeditating an attack on him during his testimony. He even warned that he might walk out of the State Capture Commission of Inquiry if Zondo displayed hostility towards him. “It is true that Zondo has a predetermined agenda and I am sure that he is already discussing with his evidence leaders how to attack me, but I fear nothing because nothing they throw at me I cannot handle. I am going there to do what I have long said I would do and that is to tell the truth,” Montana told the Daily News this week. “I am not going to allow anyone to harass me, not Zondo nor his evidence leader, will have a free ride and harass me. If they do what they do to others and try to harass me, I will just pack my things and leave without saying a word,” he said. WATCH FEED HERE AFTERNOON SESSIONS   MORNING SESSION  He also said that it was disappointing to watch Prasa collapse at the hands of those who blamed others for its collapse. Montana said he would prove to the commission that it was chasing after the wrong people and protecting criminals. The commission was adjourned early yesterday, after evidence leader Advocate Mabel Sesi Baloyi told the commission that there were certain issues to be dealt with regarding former Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti's affidavit. Advocate Sesi Baloyi requested they be given some time to address these issues before continuing with Nkwinti's  evidence. Zondo allowed this and Nkwinti will give evidence on another day. kailene.pillay@inl.co.za Political Bureau
