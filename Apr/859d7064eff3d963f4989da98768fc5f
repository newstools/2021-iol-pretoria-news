There has been little activity outside the council chambers although a heavy police presence has been dispatched â€“ with a few streets leading to the council chambers have been closed. Ramaphosa is expected to testify on Thursday and return to the inquiry for two more days in mid-May to wrap up his appearance. The inquiry has over the past two years heard much evidence that has implicated the ANC and some of its members. It is expected that Ramaphosa may need to answer questions on what the ANC did once state capture allegations were presented to the party's leaders. Ramaphosa was the deputy president of the ANC while former president Jacob Zuma was at the helm of the party's leadership and the president of the country when the bulk of the allegations of state capture first surfaced. He can expect to answer on what the party did and what he had attempted to do about concerns on the Gupta family's influence in party and government business. zintle.mahlati@inl.co.za Political Bureau
