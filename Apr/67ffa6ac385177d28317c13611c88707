Johannesburg – President Cyril Ramaphosa and his delegate have arrived in Maputo, Mozambique to attend a summit to address terrorist attacks that have taken place in the country. The extraordinary double Troika Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) is under way. The meeting provides an important platform for regional engagement on measures to be taken to resolve the security challenges confronting Mozambique.
