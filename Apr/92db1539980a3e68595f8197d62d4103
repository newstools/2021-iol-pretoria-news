Vaccine registration for persons 65 and over is not open yet The  Department of Health has slammed reports that people 65 and over can register for vaccines. Earlier on Thursday, messages began circulating on social media, sending communities into a frenzy. "Vaccine registration is now open for people ages 65 and over. Please register the elderly for their vaccines as soon as possible. Even if you under 65 you can still register for now. Your turn will be according to the phased in approach," the message claimed. Spokesperson at the Department of Health, Popo Maja, said the message was not true. "The Department of Health alerts the public (that) the rumours circulating on social media claiming that the registration is now open for the elderly people of 65 of age are obnoxious and completely false. These rumours are designed to cause panic and unnecessary public disquiet. We urge the public to ignore such rumours and disinformation. The Ministry of Health will make an announcement at an opportune moment," Maja said.
