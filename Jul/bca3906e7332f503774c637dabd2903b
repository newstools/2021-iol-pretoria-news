Nkandla - As the deadline loomed for police to arrest former president Jacob Zuma, his son Edward and a handful of supporters closed the gates leading to Zumaâ€™s Nkandla homestead on Wednesday night. Edward Zuma asked the supporters to move their vehicles near the gates where the MK vets are stationed to monitor the movement of cars coming in and out of the homestead. After lining up the cars and the supporters,they started singing struggles songs, vowing that nothing will go past them. Earlier in the day, Edward addressed the media and vowed that there will be "bloodshed" if the police try to move in and nab Zuma who is supposed to hand himself in to start serving his 15 month sentence for contempt if court. At one point, an uncompromising Edward blocked a convoy of three luxury cars that came to the home. After stopping it, he was told allow them in. It was not clear who was in the convoy but upon its landing inside the home, there were chants of "Amandla!!"  Supporters of former president Jacob Zuma chased paramedics from the road leading to Zuma's home in Nkandla.

"Yes, we are reinforcing, we are reinforcing," he said amid reports that a heavy police battalion was approaching Nkandla from the nearby town of Eshowe. Edward told the supporters to allow the approaching police contingent to use the public road, but not allow them to get inside the homestead. "Don't block the road, allow them to pass but no one is allowed to come inside," he told the supporters.
